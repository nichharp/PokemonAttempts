# PokemonAttempts
2 attempts to make the Pokemon Project (NotPokemon, Pokemon)

"Pokemon" was closer to completion, but then decided to try again and made "NotPokemon".
"Pokemon" was further along but more messy since trying to get it to work took a lot of fiddling.
"NotPokemon"'s code is very similar to the walkthrough example.
